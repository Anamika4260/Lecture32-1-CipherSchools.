The logic is simple, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of the index of smaller (or equal) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap the current element with arr[i]. Otherwise, we ignore the current element.
As the partition process is done recursively, it keeps on putting the pivot in its actual position in the sorted array. Repeatedly putting pivots in their actual position makes the array sorted.
